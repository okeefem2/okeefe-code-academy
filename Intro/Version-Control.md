## Practice it

My initial idea for this is to have a set of videos here where we demonstrate working on this as a "team".

- Init a repo locally
- Make initial commit
- Attach to remote and push
- Make a branch
- Make changes, commit, push and create a pull request
- Review pull request, revert changes, commit push
- Approve and merge PR (merge strategies)
- Working concurrently on a project
- Working ahead on features (rebasing and stashing)
- Cloning and Forking projects (https and ssh)
- Tagging
- Commit History
