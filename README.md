# OK Code Academy

Our goal is to give you the tools necessary to be a job ready and effective programmer.

We will be loosely following this roadmap with some changes along our own experiences.

## Our Story

### Michael O'Keefe

The original teacher of the academy...

The trick to teaching yourself anything is consistent exposure. Only working on learning a couple times a week will not make you job ready in a reasonable amount of time. I highly recommend you spend at least 15-30 minutes a day doing something coding related, with longer sessions 1-2 hour sessions dedicated to learning as often as you can fit it into your schedule. If you have a really busy day, just read an article and watch a video and call it good. But as often as you can you should be trying to write real code every day. For awhile you will get that by following the tutorials/courses in the curriculum, and eventually you will feel comfortable enough to start coding on your own (I highly encourage this) Once you get to a certain point we will come up with a project you can work on that I will help guide through. Something that really helps is spending your idle time learning as well. podcasts/videos are great for commutes or background during a workout or lawn work, and articles are great for reading before getting up/falling asleep or on the toilet lol.

### Jake Herwaldt

The first pupil of the academy...

What really helped me make progress was tracking my time. Similar to the Pomodoro Technique (link below), I would write today's date and draw a star for every 25 minutes of coding. My daily goal was to get 3 stars. On Saturdays I would make up for any days that I did not get my goal. This technique kept me accountable because at the end of the week I could look back and see the time I spent. It also helped me see how far I had come. I highly suggest tracking your time and topics that you spend so that you can look back on where your time has gone.

The key is to not blitz through the provided material. If you have more time on your hands than just the hour or two a day then I would suggest stopping after each section and working on side projects to solidify your knowledge. If you grind through all the material in 2 months you will not be prepared enough. It is like drinking through a fire hose, you will miss a lot. By taking it slow the material will stick and when you are not coding you will find yourself meditating on the concepts that you just learned.

## Introduction - Pre req skills and knowledge

Before diving in to learning how to create applications, there are a handful of tools and topics you should understand that will help you be a more practical and effective developer in a professional environment.

- [Version Control (Git and GitHub)](./Intro/Version-Control.md)
- Terminal
- How the internet works
- Licenses & Ethics
- Problem Solving/Thinking Like a Programmer

Give these videos a watch to get a quick overview of web development ideas.

Quiz

## Code Editor

Every profession has its tools, and coders need a way to write code. Generally there are two types of programs you will hear about for writing code with: an IDE or a Text Editor. Visual Studio Code is one of my favorite Text Editors, because you can add plugins to make it into an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Once you become more comfortable with coding you will likely start to branch out and find ones that you like best.

The backbone of most web pages/applications is made of HTML CSS and JavaScript.
