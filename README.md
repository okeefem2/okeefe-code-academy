# Web Dev Path


https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/blob/master/readme.md


We will be loosely following this roadmap with some changes along my own experiences. I encourage you all to follow along with that and do some reading of the different topics involved.


For the first phase of your learning, we will focus on learning how to use the terminal in your preferred operating system (OS) and then learn Git which is a version control tool. Then familiarize you with Github, which is a website you can use to store all of the code you write. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Saving your code in a repository like Github will get you familiar with very important developer practices and tools, and will give you a place to house your portfolio, which will be necessary since you are all learning on your own time. It will also give myself and the others in this group the ability to view and critique the code you write. So if you write code, make a repo for it! Even if it is just following along with a tutorial.


After learning these essential tools I will get you start on learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript (JS, not to be confused with Java)


These are the building blocks of web development, mainly what we call Frontend development (the stuff the user sees and interacts with in the browser).


After this we will focus on learning a backend language/framework and a frontend framework, we can tailor this to each of your goals and I will have lots of resources to check out for you all to make that decision later on. Don't worry too much about this for now, just focus on one thing at a time.


It is important to know that while learning the syntax of the languages is important, the most important part is learning how to problem solve, and how to search for information. If you don't fully understand something, feel free to ask the group, or Google it and share your findings for a discussion. 


The trick to teaching yourself anything is consistent exposure. Only working on learning a couple times a week will not make you job ready in a reasonable amount of time. I highly recommend you spend at least 15-30 minutes a day doing something coding related, with longer sessions 1-2 hour sessions dedicated to learning as often as you can fit it into your schedule. If you have a really busy day, just read an article and watch a youtube video and call it good. But as often as you can you should be trying to write real code every day. For awhile you will get that by following the tutorials/courses in the curriculum, and eventually you will feel comfortable enough to start coding on your own (I highly encourage this) Once you get to a certain point we will come up with a project you can work on that I will help guide through. Something that really helps is spending your idle time learning as well. Podcasts/youtube videos are great for commutes or background during a workout or lawn work, and articles are great for reading before getting up/falling asleep or on the toilet lol.


I am trying to make this learning path as cheap as possible for you all. So some of the courses and tutorials I send will take a little more effort on your part to read through and fully understand. If you are more of a visual learner (watch videos and follow along etc) let me know, there are a lot of great video courses at udemy.com I can recommend as well, they cost a little $ and generally take awhile to work through but are very helpful and self contained as well. codecademy.com is also awesome, but recently some of my favorite courses there have been paywalled and they cost a little more $$ to access. I will occasionally supplement what is here with youtube videos and articles that expand on different topics as well.


## Text Editor


Every profession has its tools, and coders need a way to write code. Generally there are two types of programs you will hear about for writing code with an IDE and a Text Editor. Visual Studio Code is one of my favorite Text Editors, because you can add plugins to make it into an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Once you become more comfortable with coding you will start to branch out and find ones that you like.

## BEGINNER TRACK 

Start here if you have little to no experience with coding, especially with web development


### Terminal and Git

### Understanding the current state of web development

This playlist does a good job of introducing what is going on in the web development community right now, and what the different pathways are. Additionally it introduces you to VS Code which is a very powerful and free code editor that I highly recommed you all use and become familiar with.

### Frontend Development

https://learn.freecodecamp.org/
^ Go through the entire Responsive Web Design Certification and Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification path. Please note it doesn't actually take 300 hours to complete these most times

If you like reading check out this free book hosted on GitHub, I have read many parts of it and used it as a prep for my interview at my current job, it's great https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS

Then If you like this form of learning, check out the Frontend Libraries Certification as well all the way through to become familiar with some popular libraries to help with web development.

If you prefer completely free youtube vids, use these to help supplement, though if you do MAKE SURE you are following along and actually writing code, these will not be as comprehensive as FreeCodeCamp above, but could be a good

This course goes into detail on SQL Mongo and Node as well as HTML/CSS/JS, so will take longer.

### Backend Development

#### .Net/C#

## Advanced Track

Go here if you are pretty comfortable with a backend language/framework, a frontent framework and a database

## Putting It All Together, Full Stack Development

It's time to pick a tech stack you want to learn. that means we want to pick a frontend framework and a backend language/framework. There are many out there and I have worked with several.

Here are a few courses I can recommend, let's talk more about this before you start anything though this area is still in progress.
