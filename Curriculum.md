# Curriculum

## *You can do anything for a short amount of time. Give us 3 months of your time and we are convinced that you can learn the fundamentals. From there you will be running in no time.*

We suggest spending 1-2 hours a day at least 5 days a week on the material below. We warn against blitzing through the material quicker than the suggested pace. The key is to not only complete the curriculum but to really focus on understanding the details. 

Give yourself breaks but try to do some form of coding every day (watch a video, read a blog, take a quiz).

The more material you learn the more you will realize there is an endless amount of knowledge to learn. The key with coding is that learning never stops. Focus on just the topic that you are learning and the more you use something the more it will make sense. Repetition is key.
